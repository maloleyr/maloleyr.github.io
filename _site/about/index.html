<p>“Insert Professional Important Biography Here.”</p>

<p><em>Richard is a Senior Security Consultant and Ethical Hacker at OST who focuses on performing security assessment and audits for customers. Between assessments you can find Richard researching current vulnerabilities, writing tips for staying safe in this connected world and providing security awareness talks. With a passion for people, Richard uses each engagement to create positive change and promote good security hygiene within organizations.</em></p>

<p>In all seriousness my day job is with Open System Technologies, Inc. here in Grand Rapids. I spend my days working directly with clients to review, assess, and advise on their information security practices and state. When I’m not doing that I am reading, musing, and writing. I’m currently a Senior Security Consultant and Ethical Hacker which is a fancy way of saying I get to do malicious things legally (and in an ethical way).</p>

<p>Prior to joining the Security Practice at OST I worked in the enterprise technology space as a consultant with a specific focus on managing projects related to end user computing and digital transformation. I can talk networking, Microsoft, Citrix, VMware, Linux, and python. I feel most at home in a UNIX system and I tolerate Windows because I have to. I’m a software and big picture guy - I leave the hardware to someone else.</p>

<h1 id="personal-bio">Personal Bio</h1>

<p>“I’m a person too you know.”</p>

<p>Outside of work I try to avoid doing things too similar to my day job. I enjoy walking my pittie on the daily. I love the taste of a fine whiskey (bourbon or rye) or a vodka martini. Some say I eat too much steak (is there such a thing?) and there is nothing better than a perfectly roasted rib roast.</p>

<p>I try to hike once a week and when I travel I make it a point to bring my gear. Backpacking is my go to when I may have the free time and I can get away from home without the guilt.</p>

<p>Post-apocalyptic theory is something I spend way too much time considering. I’ve watched just the right amount of television series and movies and will happily debate the best survivalist theories.</p>

<p>Married. Several fur-babies. Try to enjoy a simple life. Enjoy what you have, do what you love.</p>
