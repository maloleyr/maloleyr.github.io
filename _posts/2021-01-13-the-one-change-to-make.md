It is 2021 and we all have our New Year's Resolutions. Today I ask you to make one easy change to better protect your digital self: Move from passwords to passphrases.

![XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

Please switch to using passphrases in systems, websites, and applications that you can. A passphrase is:

Easier to dream up and easier to recall.
Complex by default.
Difficult to duplicate.
Near impossible to guess by an adversary.
Use a passphrase. When you see password think passphrase.

Your local computer security guru will thank you.
