# Welcome - I'm glad that you are here.

Welcome to my simple web presence. My name is Richard and this is my new digital home away from home. In this space you'll find information about my consulting experience, my musings, and maybe some more. This home serves both personal and professional causes. I make no guarantee that this content is always correct or up to date.

# What's with the plain colors and layout?

This website is going to follow one of my own guiding principles: Keep It Simple. I find complex solutions are ultimately unnecessary. Often in life (and business) the simplest solutions are often the most effective and the least costly. So I'll start there - simple, clean, and effective.

# What will you be up to today?

Richard will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings.
