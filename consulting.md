**consultant (noun)**: *a person who provides expert advice professionally.*


Long story short - I'm a professional consultant. What does that mean? It means at a high level people ask me questions and I help them answer those questions, that is how I earn my living.

I work for a consulting firm by day therefore if you want to ask me questions and get my advice then the primary avenue is through my employer. Not sure if the question is that big? Get into contact with me and we can figure it out together.

My primary focus is on computer and information security related consulting. I often dabble in business and project management. If it involves people and technology then I will be interested.
