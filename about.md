In all seriousness my day job is with Open System Technologies, Inc. here in Grand Rapids. I spend my days working directly with clients to review, assess, and advise on their information security practices and state. When I'm not doing that I am reading, musing, and writing. I'm currently a Senior Security Consultant and Ethical Hacker which is a fancy way of saying I get to do malicious things legally (and in an ethical way).

Prior to joining the Security Practice at OST I worked in the enterprise technology space as a consultant with a specific focus on managing projects related to end user computing and digital transformation. I can talk networking, Microsoft, Citrix, VMware, Linux, and python. I feel most at home in a UNIX system and I tolerate Windows because I have to. I'm a software and big picture guy - I leave the hardware to someone else.

# Personal Bio

"I'm a person too you know."

Outside of work I try to avoid doing things too similar to my day job. I enjoy walking my pittie on the daily. I love the taste of a fine whiskey (bourbon or rye) or a vodka martini. Some say I eat too much steak (is there such a thing?) and there is nothing better than a perfectly roasted rib roast.

I try to hike once a week and when I travel I make it a point to bring my gear. Backpacking is my go to when I may have the free time and I can get away from home without the guilt.

Post-apocalyptic theory is something I spend way too much time considering. I've watched just the right amount of television series and movies and will happily debate the best survivalist theories.

Married. Several fur-babies. Try to enjoy a simple life. Enjoy what you have, do what you love.
