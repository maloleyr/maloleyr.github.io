## Professional Bio

"Insert Professional Important Biography Here."

*Richard is a Senior Security Consultant and Ethical Hacker at Vervint (formerly OST) who focuses on performing information technology security assessments, audits, and penetration tests for customers. Between assessments you can find Richard researching current vulnerabilities, writing tips for staying safe in this connected world, and providing security awareness training. With a passion for people, Richard uses each engagement to create positive change and promote good security hygiene within organizations and communities.*

In all seriousness my day job is with Vervint (formerly Open System Technologies (OST)) here in Grand Rapids. I spend my days working directly with clients to review, assess, and advise on their information security practices and state. When I'm not doing that I am reading, musing, and writing. I'm currently a Senior Security Consultant and Ethical Hacker which is a fancy way of saying I get to do malicious things legally (and in an ethical way).

Prior to joining the Security Practice at OST I worked in the enterprise technology space as a consultant with a specific focus on managing projects related to end user computing and digital transformation. I can talk networking, Microsoft, Citrix, VMware, Linux, and Python. I feel most at home in a linux/UNIX system and I tolerate Windows because I have to. I'm a software and big picture guy - I leave the hardware to someone else.

## Personal Bio

"I'm a person too you know."

Outside of work I try to avoid doing things too similar to my day job. I enjoy walking my pittie on the daily. I love the taste of a good vodka rocks, martini (vodka, up with a twist of lemon), or a bourbon (craft especially). Some say I eat too much steak (as if that is a real thing) and there is nothing better than a perfectly roasted prime rib roast.

I try to hike once a week and when I travel I try to make it a point to bring my gear. Backpacking is my go to when I have the free time and I can get away from home without the guilt.

Post-apocalyptic theory is something I spend way too much time considering. I've watched just the right amount of television series and movies and will happily debate the best survivalist theories. I'm also a big sci-fi nerd - I'll binge Stargate (SG-1, Atlantis, and Universe) annually. Die Hard is a Christmas movie and on Independence Day I have to watch ID4 and Hamilton.

Married. Several fur-babies. Try to enjoy a simple life. Enjoy what you have, do what you love.
