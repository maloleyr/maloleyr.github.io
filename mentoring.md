**mentor (noun)**: *A mentor is someone who teaches or gives help and advice to a less experienced and often younger person.*

I like to consider myself a mentor to others, especially those that are trying to get into the information technology and/or information security (cybersecurity) industry. In 2022 I took on my first official mentee - Jim - and through my mentorship Jim was able to leave a no-prospect career to join a small managed services provider in our area.

If you are looking for someone to be a mentor then I'd encourage you to reach out to me for an initial discussion.
