There are several ways for you to get into contact with me. Except via telephone. Not a big fan and I rarely make exceptions.

You can contact me via email. You'll have to do some work here.

-----> `richard.maloley [at] protonmail.com` (encrypted by default)  

My primary social media forum is the [infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange) Mastodon server. The musings there will be a heavy mix of technical, personal, political, and everything in between.

My professional social media is LinkedIn. Feel free to connect with me.

You can also find me on Signal. I'm not posting that phone number here. If you know you know. If you need to know then email me first.

You can also reach me on Twitter. I only use Twitter (it is _not_ X) to browse for infosec/political news. I no longer post content on Twitter. I just don't know how long Twitter will be a viable platform.
